# MoneyCalculation

## Overview

MoneyCalculation is a web application designed to help users manage their budget and expenses effectively. This application allows users to input their income, set financial goals, and track expenses.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- **npm**: npm is included with Node.js, so you should have it after installing Node.js.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up and run the application:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/salkao/MoneyCalculation.git
   cd MoneyCalculation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   Navigate to the project directory and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server with:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This command will start the application, and you can view it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if specified).

## Build for Production

To build the application for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `dist` directory with the production build of your application.
